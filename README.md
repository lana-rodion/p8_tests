## Description

Project 8 - Take over and improve an existing project.
Front-end Developer Training / Openclassrooms.
This project consists to add tests and fix some bugs in the "to-do-list" application code.

## Goal setting

*   Find and fix bugs in the existing project
*   Use the behavior driven development (BDD) and test driven development (TDD) 
*   Test the code with unit tests using Jasmine, the test framework for JavaScript 
*   Optimize application performance and improve an existing project
*   Write technical documentation (audit) for this application

## Specification

### Step 1 - Find and fix bugs 
<https://github.com/lana-rodion/p8_tests/tree/step1_fix>

*   Recover the existing project 
*   Install Node modules and the latest version of Jasmine
*   Find and fix bugs

### Step 2 - Write unit tests

*   Save time by adopting the test driven development (TDD) method 
*   Write unit tests using Jasmine in ControllerSpec.js    
### Step 3 - Optimize application performance 

*   Analyze the performance of a competitor site to identify what is working well and what is not 
*   Use the browser's development console to analyze site performance
*   Write the performance audit 

### Step 4 - Improve the "to-do-list" project  

*   Write the project documentation : user's guide
*   Write functional documentation
*   Write the performance audit for "to-do-list" and improvement proposals
### Delivery

*   Project code improved and updated
*   Project technical documentation with the performance audit 

### Skills assessed

*   Develop an application with TDD (test driven development) method 
*   Use Jasmine Javascript framework to write unit tests
*   Test, find and fixe bugs in the code

***Note***: The project is realized independently for the Front-end Developer Training
